The stench of wet moss emanates from above.  You follow a blue glowing circuit embedded in the rocks at your feet.  At times you lose it in the bushes and have to wade through thorns to keep on your path.  Where this circuit leads, you do not know.
#
#You have followed the circuit for so long, you lost track of time.  Has it been hours or days?  As you consider giving up and turning back, you come upon a boulder with a figure sitting on it.  The figure appears to be a statue, but has subtle, organic movements.  Its shoulders appear relaxed, and its feet sway to and fro.  Its eye stalks track you, scanning you up and down.
